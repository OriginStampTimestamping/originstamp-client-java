### OriginStamp

OriginStamp.com can be used to prove the existence of a record at a specific point in time.
The resulting timestamps can be used, for example, to secure supply chains, prove damage, simplify regulatory compliance, and prove the authorship of data, such as photos.
Originally launched in 2011 as a research project to protect researchers ideas,
OriginStamp has now become a commercial product and the leading platform for blockchain-based timestamps due to the ever-increasing demand.
